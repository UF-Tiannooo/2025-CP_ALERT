Alert+ is a small and portable device that a person can carry, with plans to offer it in the 
form of a keychain or in the future, a watch. With a simple location ping from the parent, the 
device can send a location ping to registered family contacts and can also trigger a gentle sound, 
light, or vibration to notify the child/children if their presence is being called by their Parent by 
the connected portal.
