This project was proposed to give families a better way to stay connected and maintain 
peace of mind throughout the day. Many parents may need a simple way to check in with their 
children and share their location easily. Alert+ offers a practical solution for these everyday 
needs. 

Alert+ is a small and portable device that a person can carry, with plans to offer it in the 
form of a keychain or in the future, a watch. With a simple location ping from the parent, the 
device can send a location ping to registered family contacts and can also trigger a gentle sound, 
light, or vibration to notify the child/children if their presence is being called by their Parent by 
the connected portal.

This system is easier and more convenient than using a phone, which is not always 
accessible or practical for quick check-ins. It is designed to work using GSM for reliable 
connectivity, making it especially helpful for parents who want to know when their children have 
arrived safely at school or for family members to request attention without needing to make a 
phone call.
